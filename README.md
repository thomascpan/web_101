Description: Now that you know what web developers do, it's time to start thinking about how they actually do it. In this course, you'll learn the foundational concepts of web programming. By the end, you will be able to build a simple webpage, style it, and add elements of interactivity while working comfortably from the command line. You will be comfortable with basic scripting in Ruby and Javascript as well as more unfamiliar things like Git and databases. We will cover a lot of knowledge and you'll be able to get your hands dirty with all the topics that we're going to learn in the deep-dive courses that follow.
